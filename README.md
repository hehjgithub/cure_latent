We provide some SAS and Matlab codes in the paper "Mixture proportional hazards cure model with latent variables". Please change the paths in the code file before you run the program.

For simplicity,  we just provide codes for Simulation 1. We only consider the case that the baseline hazard is linear and n=1000.  The codes for other settings are similar. The Matlab codes are used to generate the data. You only need to run the program "main.m", then the original data are generated.  "data2.m" is a function called by "main.m". Here we only provide the codes that can generate one dataset. Since the SAS code needs to call the data, please put it into the subdirectory \data after generating. The SAS code is for the proposed estimating method.  We only provide the code based on one replication (the data in the file "Coxlatent1.csv"). When you run this program, the parameter estimates and the Hessian matrix are saved in two files named "estall.csv" and "hesall.csv" in the subdirectory \result.
